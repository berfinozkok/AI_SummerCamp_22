## End-to-End Data Science Project
This project utilizes an insurance dataset to determine the relationships between medical charges and various features, including age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. We employ a variety of graphics and statistical analysis tools to identify these relationships. Following data analysis, we trained various regression models and employed cross-validation to select the best performing one, allowing us to predict medical costs based on the aforementioned features.

## Transfer Learning Project
This project consists of two separate files. In the preprocessing step, we downloaded, resized, and normalized the data, converting it into [image, label] arrays. In the subsequent step, we imported the data from the previous stage and employed the Keras Sequential model for classification.
